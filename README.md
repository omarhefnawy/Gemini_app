Abstract
This report presents Tech News, a mobile application developed using Flutter, aimed at providing users with easy access to the latest technology news and an interactive chatbot feature. The app allows users to authenticate, browse articles, and engage with a chatbot powered by AI, capable of answering questions and describing images. This project utilizes various technologies, including Firebase for authentication, Dio for API integration, and Shared Preferences for local storage.

Introduction
Tech News is designed to cater to technology enthusiasts looking for a streamlined way to stay updated with the latest news in the tech world. The application targets users who value quick access to reliable information and interactive features. The primary motivation behind this project is to combine technology news delivery with an engaging user experience through an AI-powered chatbot. The objective is to create a user-friendly application that provides a seamless flow of information while allowing users to interact with AI in a meaningful way.

Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered:
•	State Management: Managing state effectively while ensuring a smooth user experience was challenging. This was addressed by implementing the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, which helps separate business logic from UI, making it easier to manage states and events.
•	AI Integration: Integrating the AI-powered chatbot required significant research and experimentation. The solution involved using the flutter_gemini package, which facilitated interaction with AI models for generating responses based on user input.

App Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture, which enhances maintainability and scalability. The core structure consists of two main folders: core and features.
•	Core Folder: Contains shared components, including constants and navigation logic.
•	Features Folder: Divided into subfolders for different features such as authentication, chatbot functionality, and technology news articles.

Data Flow & Interactions
Data flows through the app as follows:
1.	The user logs in or registers using the authentication screen.
2.	Upon successful authentication, the home page displays a list of technology articles fetched from the API.
3.	When the user taps on an article card, the app navigates to the article detail page, displaying the selected article's information.
4.	The user can access the chatbot, where they can interact by typing questions or uploading images.

Future Work
Future improvements could include:
•	Enhancing the chatbot's capabilities by integrating more advanced AI models for better accuracy in responses.
•	Adding user feedback features to allow users to rate articles and chatbot interactions.
•	Implementing a bookmarking feature to save articles for later reading.
•	Expanding the app to include a wider variety of topics beyond technology news.
